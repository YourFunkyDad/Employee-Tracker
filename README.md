SQL has officially cooked my brain into scrambled eggs. 
Due to my OS being a bit outdated (10.16 High Sierra), I had continuous struggles simply finding the correct archived versions of MySQL, and MySQL Workbench. 

Thanks to the amazing help of Samuel for clearing some simple errors I was running into, I finally have a good start of a foundation for prompting and seeding the database. Thanks Samuel!!
